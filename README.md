# Fortinet Device Management with FortiManager

A professional network security project implementing centralized management of multiple FortiGate firewalls using **FortiManager** within a fully simulated **GNS3** environment.  
The solution demonstrates real-world Fortinet practices including device onboarding, centralized policy control, ADOM structuring, remote configuration, and system-wide troubleshooting.

---

##  Project Summary
This project implements a full Fortinet ecosystem where FortiManager acts as the central platform for:

- Managing FortiGate devices (HQ + Branches)
- Deploying and synchronizing configurations
- Installing centralized firewall policies
- Monitoring device health, reachability, and revisions
- Structuring devices and policies using ADOMs

The environment simulates a realistic multi-site enterprise network with unified security management.

---

##  Architecture Overview
- **FortiManager** — Central management console  
- **FortiGate HQ Firewall**  
- **FortiGate Branch Firewalls**  
- **Cloud/WAN Network**  
- **LAN Segments for each site**  
- Fully virtualized inside **GNS3**

This architecture mirrors how modern organizations manage multiple remote firewalls from a single interface.

##  Core Capabilities Implemented
### Centralized Device Management
Full control of FortiGate devices from FortiManager including updates, synchronization, and configuration revisions.

### ADOM-Based Organization
Logical separation of devices and policies for structured and scalable management.

### Centralized Policy Deployment
Creating and installing shared policy packages across multiple firewalls directly from FortiManager.

###  Connectivity & Monitoring
Continuous validation of:
- FGFM sessions  
- Interface reachability  
- Policy installation status  
- Device system health  

###  Troubleshooting & Diagnostics
Hands-on experience resolving:
- Policy install errors  
- Version mismatches  
- Device connectivity problems  
- VIP access and routing issues
