# Fortinet Device Management with FortiManager

## Overview

This project demonstrates deploying and managing multiple FortiGate firewalls using FortiManager in a **virtual GNS3 environment**. The aim is to centralize firewall management and monitoring across multiple devices.

## Topology

* **FortiManager**
* **FortiGate HQ**
* **FortiGate Branch 1**
* **FortiGate Branch 2**

All devices are connected via a cloud network with DHCP addressing.

## Key Configurations

* Interface setup for LAN and WAN connectivity
* Static policies (LAN → WAN & WAN → LAN)
* Virtual IPs (VIPs) for device reachability
* ADOM creation and device import in FortiManager
* Centralized policy installation and monitoring

## Achievements

* Full integration of FortiManager with all FortiGate devices
* Centralized management and configuration control
* Hands-on experience with version alignment, troubleshooting, and real-world deployment

## Tools

* **GNS3** – Virtual network simulation
* **FortiManager** – Centralized firewall management
* **FortiGate** – HQ & Branch firewalls
